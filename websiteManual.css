WHAT'S UP

WELCOME TO TAMI'S WEBSITE, 
or my mind ;) 

This is the MANUAL to understand properly the website

*/




/* First, there is a menu_nav separating the files */
    /* Inside each folder, there is the respective files with the same language */
    /* FOLDERS: 
        css
        html
        js */


/* The file names are the same as the pages of the final website */
    /* For example, 
    Contact page, the html is contact.html */


/* For each html, there is the design, which is the css folder */
    /* Each file has the same name of html and css,
    example: contact.html & contact.css */


/* Inside each CSS, every file has the following category:

    1. Design for RESPONSIVE SCREEN (monitor/pc)
        a. Inside it, the design follows the scroll of the screen,
        first the main page, and then each section following the screen
        b. For each design, first there is the main design, or the <parent>
        and then the specific designs for <siblings>, following all the same pattern

    2. Design for JS ITEMS
        a. When there is an item that isnt on the html, but I use for js
    
    3. HOVERS and ANIMATIONS

    4. Design for MOBILE SCREEN
        a. The design follows the same order as the responsive/monitor screen,
        first main page, then parents and finally siblings
        b. The design also follows the hovers and animations at the end
